•	Allocation of fallout to the processing entity based on fallout nature, origin and assigned order priority.
•	Assess order fallout for root cause and identification of preventive and corrective action
•	Implementation of corrective action(s) to address fallout
•	Verify and confirm results once  corrective actions have been performed
•	Track, monitor and manage order fallout based on order priority, jeopardy status, fallout impact and availability of resources. Escalate order to appropriate agent as needed. This task will align to Track &amp; Manage Customer Order Handling process
•	Handover to change/problem management process to address preventive action in line with established requirements
•	Restart order fulfilment process from the point of fallout to ensure all further process flows and tasks are executing normally.
•	Report fallout status to Customer Order Handling process to ensure customer and other involved parties are notified of updates and order status
•	Report analysis of order fallouts for identifying key patterns like fallout trends, top fallout categories, infrastructure and geographies in which fallouts occur, efficiency of agents and processes resolving order fallouts, etc.
