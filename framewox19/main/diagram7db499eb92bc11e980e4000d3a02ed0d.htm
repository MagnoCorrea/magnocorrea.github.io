For a dedicated Customer Order, the Customer Order Orchestration process is responsible for:
•	Customer Order provisioning orchestration: 
o	Dynamically build and schedules the product delivery workflow (sequencing Customer Order Items). This activity takes into account
§	Constraints and validation rules between Products inside the Customer Order according to pre-requisites between products, or successive Customer Orders including modification or cancellation (in-flight changes)
§	Any type of business rules based on information even external to the Customer Order. For example : high priority for VIP customers
o	Orchestrates the Customer Order Items associated with the Product being provisioned according to the workflow
o	Triggers exception process or delivery planning update, depending on Customer Order events such as cancellation or delivery events.
•	Customer Order provisioning activities identification: Identifies &amp; publishes corresponding components needed for each Customer Order Item associated with a product
o	Identifies &amp; publishes CustomerFacingServices needed for each non-tangible product realised by the enterprise. The request will result in Service Orders through Issue Service Order process
o	Identifies &amp; publishes Resources needed for each tangible product stored by the enterprise. The request will result in Resource Orders through Issue Resource Orders process
o	Identifies &amp; publishes Supplier products needed for each product not realized by the company. The request will result in Business / Partner Orders through Issue Business / Partner Orders  
•	Customer Order provisioning activities tracking: Captures the components delivery status and deduces the status of the products it publishes. The delivery statuses concern the following:
o	CustomerFacingServices order items published by “Service Configuration and Activation” process,
o	Resources order items published by “Resource Provisioning” process,
o	And Supplier products order items published by “Business Partner Order Handling ” process
